<p class="indianred">Hello my name is Annie Dinculescu, I was born in 1998 January 14th. I come from a family of 8, two sisters, and three brother my parents, and me of course. I am romanian as you can tell by the big family and the last name. I am in graphic design at St.Clair centre of the Arts, I hope to be one once I am finished. I am interested in photography and art design. I love pizza, long boarding, and of course drawing. </p>

    <p>A little more about me; I work at Arby's, I like to snow board in the winter, I graduated from St.Joseph's High School. I am a very outgoing, funny, and out there person, once you'll get to know me you'll start to see those traits. I hope to become the best of what I can be in graphic design.  </p>
